# Version check blocker for ACF
## No more ugly messages in the chat!

Suppresses version checks for *[ACF](https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF), [ACF-Missiles](https://github.com/Bubbus/ACF-Missiles), [ACF-3](https://github.com/Stooberton/ACF-3) and [ACF-3-Missiles](https://github.com/TwistedTail/ACF-3-Missiles)*.

It's worth noting that for **nrlulz**'s ACF it will only block printing to the chat.  
It's not possible to reliably suppress the request to that addon's GitHub page.
